## Computers and the DIY trend

For a robot to do its task it need something that gives it the commands, usually a computer alone or a computer with a human help. 
That way it suitable to say that a robot brain is a computer.
Now if think about computers we will realize that they are older then we think, but yet not exactly an old technology. 
The first computing machine was created by Charles Babbage in 1822 and it was capable of computing sets of numbers and print them. 
For a long time computers would work with binary numbers, making calculations and being use for very specific purposes and companies. 
Only in 1981 it was invented the first personal computer by IBM, from there on computers would start to make more 
difference on common people life.
Now a days we have things like the Arduino and the Photon, they are cheap and small micro computers that can be used 
to sense the world with sensors for light, temperature, movement and so on and they can also communicate to the world via servos,
 LEDs, buzzers, displays. They are a mark of how cheap and spread computers are becoming every day and they began 
a new trend of the DIY (Do It Yourself). Want a lamp that changes color according to the weather forecast? 
They can do it! Want cloths with a Neo Pixel display that reacts to sound? They can do it! Want a keychain that makes sound 
when you lost it? They can do it! Want to play around with LEDs just because you can? Well, they can do it! 
And those small devices are a perfect low budget robot brain. All you need are some also cheap parts and sensors and imagination. 
So now anyone can grab one of those and put their creativity to work.
