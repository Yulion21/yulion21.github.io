## What is Architecture?


**"I call architecture frozen music" _-Goethe_**

Architecture is the art of working with space. It is important to say that architecture
is not only closed space, but also opened spaces like parks. It is not only the space itself, but 
also how that space is organized and what people will feel while using the space.
Architecture can shelter, can touch ours feelings, can tell stories, can hold history and much more.


## What is a Robot?

A robot is a machine that is programmed to execute a task. Usually we use robots to make repetitive tasks, jobs
that would demand too much effort or strength for a human been or to accomplish missions on dangerous environments.
They can be controlled by a human directly or remotely or they can be controlled by a computer that follows a program.
Robots can be as simples as toys or automatic vacuums or as complex as mechanical arms that realize precise surgeries.
Not all of them look like a bunch of metal pieces, there are also androids robots that resemble to humans.


## How Could a Robot be Architectural?

Robots can do more than clean our houses or assemble our cars. They could assemble our houses!
This is a science still in its early days, but there are a lot of universities and companies researching on
robots that can helps us built buildings. The results are exciting: robots that cut and build wood facades,
some that can pile bricks up with precision, robots that can 3D print a whole building, mechanical saws that
can make organic and complex cuts into marble, and those are just some examples.

## How Could Architecture be Robotic?

Even after being built a building can work with robotics. A building can make use of mechanical systems to
improve the user experience through beauty or comfort. It is possible to make moving facades, dancing lights
solar protections that move automatically, sensors that let you know about the surroundings quality and so on.
It is even possible to make the whole house a robot: a house that moves according to the season.
