## What is Architecture?

**"I call architecture frozen music" 
                           _-Goethe_**
                           

Architecture is the art of working with space. It is important to say that architecture
is not only closed space, but also opened spaces like parks. It is not only the space itself, but 
also how that space is organized and what people will feel while using the space.
Architecture can shelter, can touch ours feelings, can tell stories, can hold history and much more.


## What is a Robot?

A robot is a machine that is programmed to execute a task. Usually we use robots to make repetitive tasks, jobs
that would demand too much effort or strength for a human been or to accomplish missions on dangerous environments.
They can be controlled by a human directly or remotely or they can be controlled by a computer that follows a program.
Robots can be as simples as toys or automatic vacuums or as complex as mechanical arms that realize precise surgeries.
Not all of them look like a bunch of metal pieces, there are also androids robots that resemble to humans.
