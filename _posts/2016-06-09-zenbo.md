## ASUS Zenbo

During this yearâ€™s Computex (a computer exposition in Taiwan), ASUS showed us a little surprise: Zenbo.
The Zenbo is a little low cost domestic robot. It was developed to help with household activities and to be children friendly. 
This little fellow can move freely on its own, has face and voice recognition, can talk and tell stories to children, record 
and take photos and a little bit more. It can also connect to other devices like the house lights, the house digital lock, 
TVs and cellphones. In summary, the Zenbo looks like a moving smartphone, so what is the deal with it?
According to ASUS, the Zenbo is able to learn with the house routine, for instance, it can learn that at night we prefer 
calm music and can use to help you sleep. It can learn your children favorite story to tell them again when they ask for it. 
Another good point is that the robot also have an open system, like smartphones, meaning that it can receive upgrades like apps.
The robot is cheaper than most notebooks, being considered a low cost robot with the price of US$ 599.00.
