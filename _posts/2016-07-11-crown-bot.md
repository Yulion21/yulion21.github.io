## Look into the project
The idea is to create a robot that display information about the space it is in like temperature and noise with graphic bars 
and even the weather in the outside with pixelated images describing the weather condition. The robot itself should be a display 
of RGB LED of 32 x 16 LEDs showing an eye and feedback for the information it is gathering from its surroundings with the help of 
temperature and humidity sensor, a photo cell, a microphone and the internet. The eyes gives the robot a curious personality, 
since it looks around randomly, this is a way to make the robot more friendly and approachable by users. With all of this the whole 
building will look like a robot and will have an enhancement on its communication to the users.

## Here are some images of the Weather Forecast function
