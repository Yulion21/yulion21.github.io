## The First Project

Last Fall I took the Introduction to Digital Fabrication class at IIT. The class is based in the Maker Movement and
 our project was to make any device using an Arduino Uno (see mu post about Arduino [here]( http://yulion21.github.io/technologies/2016/06/06/computers_DIY/).
My project consisted in a wooden pyramid cut in a laser cutter that used an Arduino and a Photon to show 
the room temperature and the weather outside. The top of the Pyramid light according to the room temperature and the faces 
according to the weather temperature and each face represents a weather condition, so the only light to show in the faces 
is the one the represents the weather outside.
